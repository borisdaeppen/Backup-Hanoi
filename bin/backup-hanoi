  backup-hanoi tells you where to write your next backup

  You need to list your devices in a text file, separated by newline

  example usages:

    # list repeatable pattern
    backup-hanoi device-list.txt

    # list which device should be used for backup number 40
    backup-hanoi device-list.txt 40

    # create a device-list for the backups 40 up to 60
    backup-hanoi device-list.txt 40 60
