=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is an early release.
This code is currently not used in production by the author.
Use it with care!

 my @devices = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D');
 my $backup  = Backup::Hanoi->new(\@devices);

 # calculate the next 100 backup cycles
 for (0 .. 99) {
     print $backup->get_device_for_cycle($_);
     print "\n";
 }

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

Takes a reference to a list with at least three items.

=head2 get_device_for_cycle

Give a positive integer greather than zero, receive a string which reprecents the selcted item.
